1. Can you reach a high accuracy on the test set using random forests? 

I believe it is not possible to achieve high accuracy on this test set using random forests.
This is because DTs are not performant when it comes to low dataset with a large quantity of features.

2. Can you think of a better way to choose split functions as opposed to the method in _find_split?

Here, we are splitting into two, however as mentioned in 3. This dataset is high in features and thus perhaps multivariate splits will be much better.

3. How does this challenge differ from that with the occupancy dataset?

Incredibly high in features, small dataset where as occupancy is low in features, large dataset.
