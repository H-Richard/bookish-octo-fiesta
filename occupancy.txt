1. Is a single DT prone to over-fitting with the occupancy dataset?

Yes, upon running occupancy with 1 tree, regardless of other params, often there will be seeds that yield an incredibly low Test Accuracy with an extremely high train accuracy.
This is especially apparent when running occupancy with min_entropy as something such as 0.1, 
Seed: 30403 yields: Train Accuracy: [99.42281714] - Validation Accuracy: [91.70731707] - Test Accuracy: [56.38843314]

2. How does classification accuracy behave as a function of the number of trees?

Classification accuracy goes up as number of trees grows. This curve has high resemblence to something like f(x) = -1/x.

3. Do you think the random forest was helpful?  Explain.

Absolutely, since single DT is prone to over-fitting, random forest helps solve this problem.
